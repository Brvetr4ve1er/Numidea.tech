# What only the owner can supply

The site leaves a place for each item below and shows nothing until the real
thing exists: no placeholders, no invented content. This file is not deployed.
Status as of 2026-10-12 (updated after the review round).

## 1. Legal notice + privacy page
Fill every `null` in `scripts/legal-data.mjs`. `false` means "does not apply"
and is accepted. Then run `npm run build`: it writes `legal/`, adds the
"Mentions légales / Confidentialité" links to the footer and the contact form,
and the page joins the deploy, the sitemap and every gate. Until the last field
is filled, nothing is published and `check.mjs` refuses any link to `legal/`.

Fields: legal name, legal form (e.g. auto-entrepreneur), capital (or `false`),
postal address, contact email, registration label and number (ANAE card / NIF),
publication director, GitHub's postal address (public, in GitHub's terms),
retention period for enquiries, the email for privacy requests, the ANPDP
declaration status (or `false`), the licence for the site's text and images
(`cc0` keeps the current LICENSE; `reserved` reserves them), and the date of the
review. Preview with the gaps marked: `node scripts/build-legal.mjs --preview`
→ `legal-preview/` (never deployed).

Five of those are text that changes with the language, so each takes one
value per language, `{ fr, en, ar }`: the legal form, the capital, the
registration label, the retention period and the ANPDP status (for example
`retention: { fr: '3 ans après le dernier échange', en: '3 years after the
last exchange', ar: '3 سنوات بعد آخر تواصل' }`). A plain string there counts
as missing in all three languages. Names, numbers, addresses and emails take
one value. The build counts 14 fields; a translated field with gaps counts
once per missing language.

The hosts list names GitHub only. If the Netlify or Vercel mirror is public,
add `'netlify'` / `'vercel'` to `hosts` so the privacy page names every host
that serves the site.

The footer shows only "© 2026 Numidea Labs". It used to add "Tous droits
réservés", but the repository's LICENSE is CC0 (public domain), and the two
contradicted each other. Choose with `ip.licence`: `cc0` keeps the LICENSE as
it is; `reserved` means changing the LICENSE (for example to cover the code
only) before the footer says "all rights reserved" again.

## 2. Client quotes (voices)
Add an entry to `VOICES` in `scripts/voices-data.mjs`, then `npm run build`.
The quote appears under the work grid and on that client's project sheet, in
the language the client gave it. The build refuses an entry without a past
consent date and a note of where the consent is kept, a quote over 280
characters, or a client that is not a delivered one (never the Glaive demo or
WorkspaceHQ). Only Bordj Steel, Alliance Travel, AlmaFlowClim and Nomara
Voyages can be quoted. Get written agreement to the exact text.

## 3. Founder photo
A real photo, never a generated face: square, at least 400 px, saved as
`assets/founder.webp`. In `index.html` (#founder, `.fd-photo`), uncomment the
`<img>` line; the monogram steps aside. Run `npm run bump`.

## 4. Team
The three specialists show initials only. To show a person, replace their
initial with `<img src="assets/team/<x>.webp" alt="" width="88" height="88">`
inside `.tm-i` (comment above the team list). **Confirm the claim**: the site
says "four specialists" (hero, "three specialists around him", "a
four-person studio" in the brand-identity service; the proof band's "4
personnes dans l'équipe" counter went on 2026-10-26). If that is no longer
true, say so and the copy changes in all three languages.

The team card gives first contact and "turning the idea into scope" to S
(sales and partnerships). FAQ 6 therefore no longer says "the person who
scopes your project is the one who codes it"; it says one team scopes, codes
and ships. If the builder is in fact on every scoping call, that stronger
line can come back.

## 5. Studio email on its own domain
Today every contact point uses `hamissemohamedyasser@gmail.com`. Once a domain
mailbox exists, replace the address in `index.html` (links, text and the
JSON-LD), `assets/app.js` (the form's mailto) and `hub/index.html`, then
`npm run check`. It fails until all of them match. The domain also gives a
stable address for the legal page and for cold email (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
Pointing the site itself at the domain is in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md#6-domain-and-dns).

## 6. Clients' permission for paid ads
The Bordj Steel and Alliance Travel ad cards (campaign kit) need each client's
written permission before they run in paid ads. An email or WhatsApp message
is enough; keep it.

## 7. Nomara Voyages
Shown as delivered work. Confirm it is a real client with permission to show
the site; otherwise it comes off the work grid, the hero plate, the counts and
the client logo strip (its `<li>` in index.html, `assets/clients/nomara.webp`,
its rule in styles.css and its block in `scripts/client-logos.mjs`), and its
card's benefit line (`proj6.gain` in app.js); `nomara` then leaves
`VOICE_CLIENTS` in `scripts/voices-data.mjs`, the list `check.mjs` holds the
strip and the benefit lines to.

The logo strip ("Ils nous ont confié leur site") shows each client's own
logo, in one theme colour. Using a client's logo on the studio's site is
usually agreed with the client; the same email or WhatsApp message as for
item 6 can cover it.

## 8. Arabic native review
The Arabic copy was written for this site and needs a native speaker's pass.
Conventions to keep: Western digits, forward arrows `←`, singular "you", brand
names in Latin script except نوميديا in prose. Points worth a second look:
- the services title (`svc.title`) reads as a question but ends with a period;
- "Shopify بواجهة مستقلة (headless)";
- the tag pills;
- the estimator's counted nouns (`price.*.n` in app.js: one, two, 3–10, 11–99,
  100+, e.g. «60 منتجاً», «16 أسبوعاً»);
- the privacy paragraph on ad parameters (`scripts/build-legal.mjs`);
- the Gulf versus Maghreb word choices in the campaign kit.

Written or changed in October 2026 (round 5), in `assets/app.js`; each says
what its French and English counterparts say:
- `founder.skillsNote`, the CV's "about 20 % less production time":
  «تقليص وقت الإنتاج بنحو 20٪ بفضل دمج أدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي.» (the
  "currently learning" half is unchanged);
- `f1.brief` and `f3.brief`, each one sentence shorter (their tool lists
  went; the pills under them name the tools);
- `faq2.a`: no-break spaces in «90 000 دج», and the new
  «(وبالأورو والدولار في القسم نفسه)»: الأورو (Maghreb usage, like the
  timeline's month names) or اليورو?
- the contact form's copy button and its two lines: `form.copy`
  «نسخ رسالتي», `form.copied`
  «نُسخت رسالتك. الصقها في بريد إلكتروني جديد إلى العنوان أعلاه.» and
  `form.copyFail` «تعذّر النسخ: رسالتك محدَّدة، انسخها بنفسك.»

Written on 2026-10-26 (owner decisions), in `assets/app.js`:
- `proof.line`, the trust line that replaced the four counters under
  «01 — الإثبات»: «4 مواقع مُسلَّمة · الردّ في أقل من 24 ساعة عمل ·
  بالفرنسية والإنجليزية والعربية» (French: "4 sites livrés · réponse < 24 h
  ouvrées · FR · EN · AR"). The languages are written out as in
  `contact.vReply`; the title block lists them Arabic first
  (`tb.langV`). Which order reads better here?
- `work.lead`, the line under «أعمال مختارة.», now that the two cards in
  progress are off the page: «مواقع عملائنا، تصفّحها بنفسك، إضافةً إلى عرض
  تجريبي.» (French: "Les sites de nos clients, à visiter vous-même, et une
  démo de portfolio."). The clause «ومشروعين قيد الإنجاز» was dropped; does
  «عرض تجريبي» alone say "a portfolio demo" here, as it does on the card's
  pill (`work.concept`)?
- renumbered when the tools section («أدوات متينة») and its plate left the
  page; only the number changed in each: `faq.kicker` «07 — الأسئلة»,
  `contact.kicker` «08 — تواصل», `pl.light` «لوحة 4 — رأس كاربون · بجاية»,
  `pl.dunes` «لوحة 5 — العرق الكبير». The section's own strings (`stack.*`,
  `pl.strata`) are gone and need no review.
- `hero.cta2`, the hero's second button, which now opens WhatsApp with
  the Aperçu message (`prev.waText`, unchanged) instead of leading to the
  projects: «راسلنا عبر واتساب» (French: "Écrire sur WhatsApp"; English:
  "Chat on WhatsApp"). It replaced «شاهِد أعمالنا». The verb follows
  `form.successAlt` («راسلنا مباشرة»); is «عبر واتساب» or «على واتساب»
  more natural on a button?
- nothing new from the footer trim: its column headings
  (`footer.studioH`, `footer.contactH`, `footer.founderH`), the signoff
  (`footer.signoff`) and the WorkspaceHQ cartridge (`whq.kick`, `whq.sub`)
  left the page and need no review.

Files: `assets/app.js` (both `ar:` blocks carry a banner), the `UI.ar` and
project `ar` texts in `scripts/scene-data.mjs`, and the `lang="ar"` lines in
`404.html`.

## 9. Clients' own domains
The cards link the Netlify builds, because none of the clients' domains serves
the delivered site:
- `bordj-steel.com`, `alliance-travel.dz` and `nomaravoyages.com` do not resolve
  (NXDOMAIN);
- `almaflowclim.fr` serves a different Hostinger site;
- the two projects in progress (Doctor Cherfia, Étoile de l'Est) have no
  card on the page until each site is live (owner decision, 2026-10-26);
  each then comes back with its own screenshot, link and browser bar.

When a client points a domain at the build, run `node scripts/verify-domains.mjs`.
It reports a domain as switchable only when it serves the same site. Then the
link changes in one place per client (`check.mjs` keeps the plate, card,
browser bar and project sheet in step).

## 10. Hub fan art
`hub/` (the founder's personal page) shows fan art. Confirm the rights to show
it, or take it down.

## 11. Supabase lead store
It is off: the keys in `index.html` are empty. Switching it on needs:
- the legal page published;
- the database region set in `scripts/legal-data.mjs` (`privacy.supabaseRegion`);
- a new `form.note`, because the current one promises the site keeps nothing.

`check.mjs` enforces all three.

## 12. Campaign kit and this repository
This repository is **public**. The campaign kit (strategy, budget, client
permissions) was removed from it on 2026-10-12 and is now with the owner as a
zip. It is still in the git history of earlier commits. Removing it from
history needs a force-push rewrite (e.g. `git filter-repo --path campaign
--invert-paths`, then `git push --force`), which also rewrites every later
commit. That is the owner's call, best done when no pull request is open.
`knowledge-base/` and `audit/` are also readable on GitHub (never on the site).
[RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md#8-the-git-history) has the facts for the decision:
which refs hold the kit today, what GitHub Support will and will not remove,
and why the rewrite is cleanest before Dependabot's first pull request.

## 13. WorkspaceHQ: open source
The site called WorkspaceHQ "open source" and told visitors to "follow the
README". On 2026-10-13 the repository `Brvetr4ve1er/workspace-HQ` had no
licence file and no README, and `dashboard/package.json` is `"private": true`
with `"start": "electron ."`: public code without a licence is not open source,
and it is a desktop (Electron) app, not a CLI. The pages now say the code is
public on GitHub and describe a desktop console. To say "open source" again,
add a LICENSE (for example MIT) and a root README with the start steps to
that repository, then restore the wording in `workspacehq/index.html` and
`scripts/scene-data.mjs` (`npm run scene`).

## 14. Claims only the owner can confirm
Each is on the site today. None is proven false; none could be verified.
Confirm it, or say what is true and the copy changes in all three languages.
- **"6 ans" of experience** (founder card) next to freelance work "2019 —
  aujourd'hui", which is about 7 years in October 2026.
- **"des clients en France"** (FAQ 5, plural): the portfolio shows one French
  client (AlmaFlowClim).
- **"nous livrons avec … React, Next.js, Vercel"** (market note): every
  delivered build linked from the site is served by Netlify, and only Bordj
  Steel shows Next.js.
- **Essentiel: "Mise en ligne, domaine et certificat configurés"**: no
  delivered client site is served from its own domain yet (see 9).
- **AlmaFlowClim labelled "Industrie"**: its own site presents a residential
  heating, air-conditioning and plumbing business.
- **"Si c'est oui, on est déjà à mi-chemin"** (method, step 4) after a
  one-page Aperçu, for projects of up to 16 weeks.
- **hub/: "VOIDSPLUNKER.std is an agency of one"** while the home page
  presents a studio of four specialists.
